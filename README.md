# WORDLE using PyGame
this was an attempt to make a WORDLE clone using pygame but I wasn't satisfied with the results.
gametry1 in the tries directory was the first code I wrote to simply see the logic.
I'll be making a wordle clone using WebDev now.


ps: I made this clone in less than 6hrs, so its pretty decent
pps: The tries directory containes all the failed attempts
Have fun!
